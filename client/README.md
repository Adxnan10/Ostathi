Please note that some links don't make sense but we set it that way to show major pages. Also, there is 2 more pages that are not covered in the video but you can explore them yourself. Lastly, all pages are dynamic and responsive.

## Tools required

You need to install Node js (v18.15.0) and make sure that npm is updated.

To check the versions of Node and NPM run the following commands:
### `node -v`
### `npm -v`

## Running the project

First make sure that you are in the project's client directory. i.e,
C:\Users\Adnan\Desktop\repos\GitHub\Ostathi\client>

Then, **in the project directory**, run the following command to install all the required packages:

### `npm install`


Then run the following command to launch the website:

### `npm run dev`

This command launches the website in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

*Note: If port 3000 is busy, then the website will automatically connect to another port which you can see in the terminal.*
